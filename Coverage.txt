Problem
        Suppose a client needs a database design for his blog website 
        and see the differences between RDBMS and MongoDB schema design. 
        Website has the following requirements.
            Every post has the unique title, description and url.
            Every post can have one or more tags (java, node, database).
            Every post has the name of its publisher and total number of likes.
            Every Post have comments given by users along with their name, message, 
                data-time and likes.
            On each post there can be zero or more comments.
